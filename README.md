# üìä RFM Segmentation Project

## üß† Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a complete **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Segmentation** workflow using **MySQL and Power BI**.  
The goal is to classify customers into meaningful segments and extract actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.  

---

## ‚úÖ Workflow Steps  

- üìÇ Created a dedicated MySQL database: `RFM_SALES`  
- üì• Imported sample data into the `SAMPLE_SALES_DATA` table  
- üìä Computed customer-level metrics: **CLV, Frequency, Quantity Ordered, Recency**  
- üè∑Ô∏è Built RFM Segmentation and created view: `RFM_SEGMENTATION_DATA`  
- üìà Aggregated results to analyze segment-level metrics

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Use Database  

```sql
CREATE DATABASE RFM_SALES;
USE RFM_SALES;
```
**Import Data**
## 1.Sample Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM sample_sales_data LIMIT 5;
```
## output

## 2.Customer-Level Metrics Query

```sql
SELECT 
    CUSTOMERNAME,
    ROUND(SUM(SALES),0) AS CLV,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ORDERNUMBER) AS FREQUENCY,
    SUM(QUANTITYORDERED) AS TOTAL_QTY_ORDERED,
    MAX(STR_TO_DATE(ORDERDATE,'%d/%m/%y')) AS LAST_TRANSACTION_DATE,
    DATEDIFF(
        (SELECT MAX(STR_TO_DATE(ORDERDATE, '%d/%m/%y')) FROM SAMPLE_SALES_DATA),
        MAX(STR_TO_DATE(ORDERDATE, '%d/%m/%y'))
    ) AS RECENCY
FROM SAMPLE_SALES_DATA
GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME
LIMIT 5;
```

## Output:
| CustomerName                 | CLV     | Frequency | Total\_Qty\_Ordered | Last\_Transaction\_Date | Recency |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |

```
## 4.Final Segmentation
```sql
SELECT * FROM RFM_SEGMENTATION_DATA LIMIT 5;
```

| CustomerName            | Recency | Frequency | MonetaryValue | R\_Score | F\_Score | M\_Score | Segment   |

## 5.Final RFM

```sql

SELECT
    CUSTOMER_SEGMENT,
    SUM(MONETARY_VALUE) AS TOTAL_SPENDING,
    ROUND(AVG(MONETARY_VALUE),0) AS AVG_SPENDING,
    SUM(FREQUENCY_VALUE) AS TOTAL_ORDERS,
    SUM(TOTAL_QTY_ORDERED) AS TOTAL_QTY
FROM RFM_SEGMENTATION_DATA
GROUP BY CUSTOMER_SEGMENT;
```

## Output:

| Customer Segment    | Total Spending | Avg Spending | Total Orders | Total Qty Ordered |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Champions           | 367,337        | 61,223       | 17           | 3,968             |

| Promising Customers | 3,329,075      | 184,949      | 50           | 32,178            |
| Needs Attention     | 3,473,776      | 231,585      | 47           | 33,536            |
| At Risk             | 2,312,250      | 289,031      | 31           | 22,820            |
| Lost/Inactive       | 6,148,617      | 558,965      | 80           | 61,298            |

## üîé Key Insights
- **Champions & Loyal Customers** ‚Üí Most engaged and profitable customers.  
- **Needs Attention & About to Sleep** ‚Üí Customers at risk of churn, require re-engagement.  
- **Lost/Inactive Customers** ‚Üí Historically high spenders but need reactivation efforts.
